# Staking Facilities Test Assignment


## Summary:
This is a Terraform project that does the following:
1. Creates a Ubuntu EC2 instance in AWS with 2 network interfaces and a public IP that is auto-assigned as a AWS elastic IP.
2. Installs Python and Ansible on the instance.
   - Note that it is also possible to install Ansible locally and run the following steps on the remote EC2 instance. But to avoid any issues caused by differing Python or Ansible configuration or settings, this project installs and runs Python and Ansible directly on the instance.
3. Calls/ executes an Ansible playbook that does the folllowing:
    - Installs Apache2 and creates an Apache webserver.
    - Starts the Apache service and configures it to listen on port 80
    - Creates a simple html testpage that is accessible on the public IP of the EC2 instance. 


## Required:
1. An AWS account with root privileges.
2. A private key for your AWS account.
3. Terraform installed locally on your instance/ machine (preferably Ubuntu) and [added to ENV/PATH](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
4. It is assumed that your AWS setup does not have any Network ACL rules that may conflict with this setup. For this reason, it may be best to use a brand-new test AWS account.


## Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a directory/ folder in your local machine and copy all the files in this repo into this directory.
2. Copy your AWS private key file into the same directory.
3. Open a terminal window and navigate to this directory.
4. Use your preferred text editor to open and edit the terraform.tfvars file. The only values you **must** change are 'key_name' and 'ssh_key_priv' which are both the name of your AWS private key file√ü. The rest of the values can be left as-is. Save and close the file.
5. Initialize Terraform with this command in the terminal: **terraform init --upgrade** (Note that this will upgrade your Terraform installation to the latest version).
6. Run the Terraform plan with this command in the terminal: **terraform plan**
7. Execute the Terraform plan with this command in the terminal: **terraform apply**
   - If you prefer a non-interactive execution, use this command instead **terraform apply --auto-approve**
8. Wait for Terraform to complete its run.
   - Note: If you are rerunning this Terraform project immediately after running a previous 'terraform approve', the step named "Elastic IP for external interface" may fail and cause the project to stop. This is a known issue, caused when AWS does not de-allocate an old elastic IP from an old instance and rea-allocate it quickly enough. In this case, just wait about 15min until the old EC2 instance is fully deprovisioned, then you can rerun the project once more.
9. In your AWS account, a new EC2 instance has now been created. Check and copy the public IP of the created EC2 instance.
10. In a browser window, type **http://public_ip** to view the sample html test page named 'Dickson Kimani Assignment'. Note that you must use 'http://' not 'https://'
11. If no longer needed, you can undo or delete this setup using this Terraform command in the terminal: **terraform destroy --auto-approve**
    - Or if you prefer a non-interactive execution, use this command instead **terraform destroy --auto-approve**
